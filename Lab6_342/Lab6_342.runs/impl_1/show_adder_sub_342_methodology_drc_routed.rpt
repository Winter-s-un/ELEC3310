2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.301 ns between reset (clocked by Clock_100Mhz) and U2/LED_activating_counter_reg[0]/D (clocked by Clock_100Mhz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.330 ns between reset (clocked by Clock_100Mhz) and U2/LED_activating_counter_reg[1]/D (clocked by Clock_100Mhz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Anode_Activate[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Anode_Activate[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Anode_Activate[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Anode_Activate[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[4] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[5] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_Seg[6] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of Clock_100Mhz.
Related violations: <none>
